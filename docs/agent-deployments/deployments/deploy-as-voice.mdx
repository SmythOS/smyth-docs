# Deploy as a Voice Agent

> Give your agent a voice. SmythOS allows you to deploy your agent as a voice-enabled assistant in two primary ways: as an embeddable chat widget for your website, or as the backend for a custom Amazon Alexa Skill.

<InfoCallout title="TL;DR">
You can deploy your agent in two ways:
1. **Website Embed:** Get the code snippet from Deploy → Voice.
2. **Alexa Skill:** Get the Endpoint URL from the Deploy → Voice.
</InfoCallout>

## Embed a Voice Chat on Your Website

This option adds a voice-enabled chat widget to your website, allowing users to talk to your agent directly from their browser.

### 1. Find Your Code Snippet

1.  In your agent, navigate to the **[Deploy](/docs/agent-deployments/overivew)** tab.
2.  In the **Embed** section, find the **Voice** option and click **Get Endpoints**.

      caption="Click 'Get Endpoints' on the Voice option in the Embed section." 
    />
3.  In the **"Voice and Alexa Integration"** modal, find the **Voice Integration** section and copy the **Code Snippet**.

      caption="Copy the Code Snippet from the Voice Integration section." 
    />

### 2. Add the Code to Your Website

Paste the snippet you copied just before the closing `</body>` tag in your website's HTML file.

The snippet will look similar to this:

```html 
<script 
  src="https://<your-id>.smyth.ai/voice.agent.js" 
  id="smythos-voice-embed" 
  data-voice-embed-id="https://<your-agent-id>/voiceEmbedment.init?cid=..."
>
</script>
<script>
  voiceEmbedment.init()
</script>
```

### 3. How it Looks

Once embedded, a microphone icon will appear on your site. When activated, the voice interface provides clear visual feedback and controls for the user.

<InfoCallout title="Personal Information">
  Note that to use the voice embedment feature, you may need to provide personal details for compliance and security purposes.

## Connect to an Amazon Alexa Skill

This option uses SmythOS to provide the backend HTTPS endpoint for a custom Amazon Alexa Skill.

### Step 1 (Development): Get Your Test Endpoint

The fastest way to start developing your Alexa skill is to use the **Test** panel. This gives you a development endpoint without needing to run a full deployment.

1.  In your agent, click the **Test** button in the top-right debug panel.
2.  Select the **Voice** tab.
3.  Copy the **Alexa Dev Endpoint**. This is the URL you will use for initial setup and testing in the Alexa Developer Console.

  alt="Finding the Alexa endpoints in the Test with Voice sidebar." 
  caption="Use the Test panel's Voice tab to get your development endpoint." 
/>

### Step 2 (Production): Get Your Stable Production Endpoint

Once you have tested your skill and are ready to deploy it, you should switch to the permanent, stable endpoint.

1.  Gi to the **[Deploy](/docs/agent-deployments/overview)** tab.
2.  Click **Get Endpoints** on the **Voice** option.
3.  From the **"Voice and Alexa Integration"** modal, copy the **Alexa Prod URL** (e.g., `...agent.pstage.smyth.ai/alexa`).

  alt="The SmythOS Voice and Alexa Integration modal showing production URLs." 
  caption="Use the Alexa Prod URL from the Deploy modal for your live skill." 
/>

### Step 3: Configure Your Skill

Now that you have your endpoint URL (from Step 1 or 2), you are ready to configure your skill.

<InfoCallout title="Next Steps for Alexa">
  Once you have this URL, you are ready to create your skill. Go to our detailed guide on [Alexa Skill](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-alexa-skill) which will walk you through the entire process in the Alexa Developer Console.

## What’s Next?

Now that you have your voice endpoints, you can:

-   **[Deploy your agent as an Alexa Skill](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-alexa-skill)** using the endpoint you just copied.
-   Explore other deployment types, like a **[web-based ChatBot](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-chatbot)**.
-   Review your agent's **[Logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs)** to see conversations from your new voice channel.

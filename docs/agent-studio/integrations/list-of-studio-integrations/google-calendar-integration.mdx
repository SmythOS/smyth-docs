## Why Connect Google Calendar with SmythOS?

Google Calendar is a cornerstone for managing time, scheduling meetings, and tracking important dates. By integrating it with SmythOS, you transform your calendar from a passive scheduling tool into an active, automated participant in your workflows.

Here’s how the **SmythOS Google Calendar integration** can streamline your operations:

* **Automate Event Creation:** Imagine an agent automatically scheduling a follow-up meeting in Google Calendar after a customer support ticket is resolved, or creating a project deadline event when a new project is initiated in another system.
* **Keep Systems in Sync:** Agents can read your Google Calendar to check for availability before scheduling resources or triggering actions, preventing conflicts.
* **Enhance Productivity:** Reduce the manual effort of switching between applications to manage your schedule. Let SmythOS agents handle calendar updates based on events and triggers within your ecosystem.
* **Centralize Time Management:** Use SmythOS as a hub to orchestrate actions that have time-sensitive components, reflecting these directly in the calendars of relevant team members.

This integration allows your agents to intelligently interact with Google Calendar, ensuring your schedule accurately reflects automated processes and that your team stays informed and organized.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Google Calendar Integration in SmythOS

Connecting Google Calendar involves a one-time setup to authorize SmythOS to access your calendar data securely using OAuth 2.0. This involves getting credentials from Google and then authenticating within SmythOS.

<InfoCallout>
  The following steps guide you through creating Google OAuth credentials and connecting to SmythOS. For a visual walkthrough, ensure you have access to any video guides provided by your team.
  _Placeholder: [Link to or embed your Google OAuth Setup Video Guide here]_
</InfoCallout>

### Part A: Obtaining Your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from Google

1.  **Go to the Google Cloud Console:**
    * Navigate to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    * Sign in with the Google account associated with the calendar you want to integrate.
    * Create a new project or select an existing one.

2.  **Enable the Google Calendar API:**
    * In the Google Cloud Console, use the search bar or navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library."
    * Search for "Google Calendar API" and select it.
    * Click `Enable` to activate the API for your project.

3.  **Configure the OAuth Consent Screen:**
    * Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen."
    * Choose the "User Type" (likely "External" if users outside your Google Workspace org will authenticate, or "Internal" if it's only for users within your org). Click `Create`.
    * Fill in the required information:
        * **App name:** Something descriptive, like "SmythOS Calendar Integration."
        * **User support email:** Your email address.
        * **App logo (optional):** Add your logo if desired.
        * **Developer contact information:** Your email address.
    * Click `Save and Continue`.
    * **Scopes:** Click `Add or Remove Scopes`. Search for and add the necessary Google Calendar API scopes. Typically, you'll need scopes like:
        * `.../auth/calendar` (Manage primary calendar and other calendars you have access to)
        * `.../auth/calendar.events` (View and edit events on all your calendars)
        * *(Consult Google's documentation for the minimal necessary scopes for the actions you intend to perform.)*
    * Click `Update`, then `Save and Continue`.
    * **Test users (if External):** Add email addresses of users who will test the integration during development. Click `Save and Continue`.
    * Review the summary and click `Back to Dashboard` or `Publish App` (if ready, though for internal use, "testing" mode is often fine).

4.  **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:**
    * Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials."
    * Click `+ Create Credentials` and select `OAuth client ID`.
    * For "Application type," select `Web application`.
    * Give it a name (e.g., "SmythOS Calendar Web Client").
    * Under "Authorized redirect URIs," click `+ Add URI` and enter:
        `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback`
        *(This is a crucial step. Ensure this URL is exactly as provided by SmythOS.)*
    * Click `Create`.

5.  **Note Your Credentials:**
    * A pop-up will display your **`Client ID`** and **`Client Secret`**.
    * **Copy these values immediately and store them securely.** You will need them to configure the integration in SmythOS.
    <WarningCallout>
        Treat your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` like passwords. Do not share them publicly. SmythOS provides a `Vault` feature for securely storing such sensitive credentials. [Learn more about SmythOS Vault here.](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement)
    </WarningCallout>

### Part B: Authenticating in SmythOS

1.  **Navigate to SmythOS Integrations:** Go to the "Integrations" section in your SmythOS dashboard.
2.  **Add Google Calendar Integration:** Find and add the "Google Calendar" integration.
3.  **Enter Credentials:** You will be prompted to enter the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` you obtained from the Google Cloud Console.
4.  **Authenticate:** Click the `Authenticate` button in SmythOS.
    * You'll be redirected to Google's sign-in and consent screen.
    * Choose the Google account you want to connect.
    * Review the permissions SmythOS is requesting (based on the scopes you configured) and click `Allow`.
5.  **Connection Complete!** You should be redirected back to SmythOS, and the Google Calendar integration will now show as connected.

## Exploring the Google Calendar Integration Components

Once your Google Calendar is connected to SmythOS, you can use the following components in your agent workflows to manage your schedule:

* **[Create Event](#component-create-event):** Adds a new event to a specified calendar.
* **[Get Event](#component-get-event):** Retrieves detailed information about a specific event.
* **[List Events](#component-list-events):** Fetches a list of events from a calendar.
* **[Patch Update Event](#component-patch-update-event):** Modifies specific details of an existing event.

<InfoCallout>
  The OAuth setup you completed in Step 1 handles the authentication for all these components. You won't need to re-enter Client IDs or Secrets for each one.

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Minimal Scopes:** During OAuth setup, only request the scopes your agents absolutely need to minimize security exposure.
* **Use `primary` for User's Calendar:** For operations on the authenticated user's main calendar, `primary` is the standard `calendarId`.
* **Time Zones:** Be explicit with time zones in `start` and `end` objects for events to avoid ambiguity, especially when dealing with users or calendars in different time zones.
* **Error Handling:** Check component outputs for errors. The `Response` object often contains detailed error messages from Google.
* **Idempotency:** When creating events, consider how to avoid duplicates if an agent run is retried. You might store created `eventId`s or use `iCalUID` for checks if appropriate.
* **`singleEvents=true` for Listing:** When listing events for a date range (e.g., "today's events"), using `singleEvents=true` is often helpful as it expands recurring events into individual instances.
* **Patch vs. Update:** Prefer "Patch Update Event" for modifying existing events as it only changes specified fields, reducing the risk of unintentionally overwriting other details. A full "Update Event" (if available as a separate component) would replace the entire event resource.
* **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of Google Calendar API rate limits. For high-volume operations, implement appropriate delays or batching if possible.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter issues with the **Google Calendar SmythOS Integration**, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

* **Authentication Errors (e.g., `invalid_client`, `redirect_uri_mismatch`):**
    * *Cause:* Incorrect `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, or misconfigured "Authorized redirect URIs" in the Google Cloud Console.
    * *Solution:* Double-check that the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` entered in SmythOS exactly match those from your Google Cloud Console project. Ensure the "Authorized redirect URI" in Google Cloud Console is precisely `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback`.

* **Permission Denied / `403 Forbidden` Errors when using components:**
    * *Cause:* The authenticated user may not have sufficient permissions for the target calendar, or the necessary API scopes were not requested/granted during the OAuth consent screen setup.
    * *Solution:*
        1.  Verify the Google account authenticated with SmythOS has appropriate access (e.g., edit rights) to the `calendarId` being used.
        2.  Review the "OAuth consent screen" configuration in your Google Cloud Console project. Ensure all required scopes (like `.../auth/calendar.events` or `.../auth/calendar`) are added. You might need to re-authenticate in SmythOS after updating scopes.

* **Event Not Found / `404 Not Found` Errors (for "Get Event" or "Patch Update Event"):**
    * *Cause:* The `eventId` is incorrect, or the event does not exist in the specified `calendarId`.
    * *Solution:* Verify that the `eventId` is correct and that the event belongs to the calendar identified by `calendarId`.

* **Incorrect `calendarId`:**
    * *Cause:* Using an invalid calendar ID.
    * *Solution:* Remember `primary` refers to the authenticated user's main calendar. For other calendars, you typically use the calendar's email address-like ID. Ensure the authenticated user has access to this calendar.

* **Invalid Date/Time Format:**
    * *Cause:* The `start` or `end` date/time objects are not in the correct RFC3339 format.
    * *Solution:* Ensure dateTime strings are like `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm`. For all-day events, date strings should be `YYYY-MM-DD`.

<InfoCallout>
  For persistent issues, consult the detailed `Response` output from the component, which often contains specific error messages from the Google Calendar API. The SmythOS support team is also available to assist. [Link to SmythOS Support Page]

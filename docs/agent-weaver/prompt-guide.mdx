# Prompt Engineering with Weaver

> **Good prompt ⇒ Great agent**  
> Weaver will try its best with whatever you throw at it, but the clearer the ask, the cleaner the wiring.  
> Think *tasks*, not *code* ... your job is to explain specifically what you want and let Weaver do the rest.

<InfoCallout title="TL;DR"> State a goal ➜ list skills ➜ add constraints. That’s 95 % of prompt craft. </InfoCallout>

## Mind-set Shift — Describe Jobs, Not Code

Bad habit (thinking like a developer):

> “Call the `summarise()` function with the weekly_sales dataset.”

Better habit (thinking like a PM):

> “Summarise weekly sales data for Monday stand-up.”

More examples:

- “Translate this blog post to Spanish.”  
- “Email the summary to the team every Friday at 4 PM.”  
- “Resize all images in `/uploads` to 1024 px wide.”

## Good vs Poor Prompts (Kyoto Edition)

1. Research attractions and local cuisine
2. Generate SEO-friendly title and slug
3. Produce Markdown article
4. Extract five focus keywords

<PromptCard prompt={`Write something about Kyoto. Make it good for SEO.`} />

> The first prompt gives Weaver four precise blocks to assemble.
> The second leaves enough ambiguity to fill a Zen garden.

## Prompt Debugging 101

1. **Locate the misbehaving component** (red border).
2. Click on the component and ask Weaver to fix it and *explain what changed* (or click Fix with AI button on the componenet):
   <PromptCard prompt={`Output missed the bullet list. Ensure summary is bullet-pointed.`} />
3. Re-run just that block with debug mode enabled and step through it, not the whole agent.
4. Rinse, repeat, ship.

> 👉 *Still wrong?* Break the skill in two. Smaller skills fail more loudly.

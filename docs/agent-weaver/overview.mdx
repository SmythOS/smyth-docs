## Best Practices

**Design**
- Start with basic functionality and gradually add complexity as needed
- Test each component and connection thoroughly during development
- Document changes and configuration decisions for future reference
- Verify all component connections and data flow patterns

**Communication**
- Be specific about requirements and expected behaviors when describing needs
- Provide concrete examples of desired inputs, outputs, and processing logic
- Use consistent terminology when referring to components and functions
- Test thoroughly across different scenarios and edge cases


**Testing and Validation**
- Always test your agent manually - AI assistance has limitations
- Verify critical functionality independently of Weaver's suggestions
- Test edge cases and error handling explicitly
- For API-dependent workflows, use the [Mock Data](components/APICall?id=mock-data) feature to test without actual API keys.
- Monitor agent performance in production environments

> **Note**: While Weaver provides intelligent assistance, manual testing and verification are essential for production deployments.

# Deploy as Alexa Skill

> **Your agent, now voice-enabled.** Connect it to Alexa and let users talk to it like a human.

<InfoCallout title="TL;DR">
  Find your agent's Alexa endpoint in the **Deploy** tab → create a **Custom** Alexa Skill → paste the HTTPS endpoint → add a custom `SmythOSAgentIntent` with an `AMAZON.SearchQuery` slot.
</InfoCallout>

## Why Deploy Your Agent to Alexa?

Voice extends your agent’s reach. Alexa integration lets users interact naturally with no screens or keyboards required. It’s ideal for:

- Personal assistants
- FAQ bots
- Home automation agents
- Productivity helpers

All it takes is one endpoint and a little setup.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following ready:

- A **[deployed SmythOS agent](/docs/agent-deployments/overview)**
- An Amazon Developer account ([sign up here](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa))

<Spacer size="md" /> 

## Step 1: Get Your SmythOS Alexa Endpoint URL

<InfoCallout title="Production Endpoint">
  For production agents, replace `stage` with `pstage` in the URL once you deploy your agent. Before deploying, you can also find a developer endpoint in the **Test** sidebar under the **Voice** tab, called "Alexa Dev Endpoint". This is useful for initial development.
</InfoCallout>

Your agent's stable Alexa endpoint is available once it's deployed.

1.  Go to your **SmythOS Dashboard** and select your agent.
2.  Navigate to the **[Deploy](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments)** tab.
3.  Under the **Embed** section, find and copy the **Alexa** endpoint URL. It will look like this:

<PromptCard prompt="https://<your-agent>.agent.stage.smyth.ai/alexa" />

<Spacer size="md" />

## Step 2: Create a New Alexa Skill in the Developer Console

1.  Visit the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).
2.  Click **Create Skill**.
3.  Enter a **Skill name** (e.g., "My SmythOS Agent") and choose a **Primary locale** (e.g., "English (US)"). Click **Next**.
4.  Choose the **type of experience**: Select **Other**.
5.  Choose a **model**: Select **Custom**.
6.  *(Optional)* You can turn on **"Automatically distribute your skill..."** if you want your skill to work in all locales with the same language.
7.  Choose a **method to host** your skill's backend resources: Select **Provision your own**. This is required to connect to SmythOS. Click **Next**.
8.  Choose a **template**: Select **Start from Scratch**. Click **Next**.
9.  Review your details and click **Create Skill**.

It will take a few moments for Amazon to build the voice model.

## Step 3: Add Your SmythOS Endpoint as the Skill Handler

1.  In the left sidebar of the Alexa console, click on **Endpoint**.

  src="/docs/img/agent_deployments/alexa-endpoint.png" 
  alt="Alexa Developer Console Endpoint Configuration" 
  caption="Set the Service Endpoint Type to HTTPS and paste your SmythOS URL in the Default Region." 
/>

2.  Set the **Service Endpoint Type** to **HTTPS**.
3.  Paste your SmythOS Alexa URL (from Step 1) into the **Default Region** text field. This is a required field.
4.  From the dropdown menu below, select **My development endpoint is a sub-domain of a domain that has a wildcard certificate from a certificate authority**.
5.  Click **Save Endpoints** at the top of the page.

## Step 4: Choose an Invocation Name for Your Skill

<Image 
  src="/docs/img/agent_deployments/alexa-invocation.png" 
  alt="Alexa Skill Invocation Name setting in the developer console" 
  caption="Choose a simple, memorable name for users to launch your skill." 
/>

1.  In the left sidebar, click the **Invocation** dropdown.
2.  Select **Skill Invocation Name**.
3.  In the **Skill Invocation Name** field, change "change me" to the phrase users will say to start your skill (e.g., "my agent"). This is how users will "open" your agent.
4.  Click **Save Model**.

<Spacer size="md" /> 

## Step 5: Add a Custom Intent for User Queries

This intent will capture everything the user says after they've opened your skill and send it to your agent.

<Image 
  src="/docs/img/agent_deployments/alexa-intent.png" 
  alt="Alexa Intent editor showing utterances and slots for SmythOSAgentIntent" 
  caption="Configure the SmythOSAgentIntent with an AMAZON.SearchQuery slot to capture all user input." 
/>
1.  Navigate to **Intents** (under the "Invocation" section in the sidebar) and click **Add Intent**.
2.  Select **Create custom intent**.
3.  Name it `SmythOSAgentIntent`. Click **Create custom intent**.
4.  In the **Sample Utterances** section, add the following (press the '+' or Enter after each one):

<PromptCard prompt="
{searchQuery}
ask {searchQuery}
tell me {searchQuery}
find {searchQuery}
search for {searchQuery}
" /> 

5.  When you add the first utterance, Alexa will prompt you to create the `{searchQuery}` slot. Click **Create slot**.
6.  In the **Intent Slots** section below, find `searchQuery` and set its **Slot Type** to `AMAZON.SearchQuery`. This built-in slot type is designed to capture free-form text.
7.  Click **Save Model**.

## Step 6: Build and Test Your Alexa Skill

<Image 
  src="/docs/img/agent_deployments/alexa-test.png" 
  alt="Alexa Skill Test console showing a successful interaction" 
  caption="Use the Test tab to simulate speaking to your skill and see the JSON request and response." 
/>
1.  Click **Build Model** at the top of the page. This may take a minute or two to complete.
2.  Once the build is finished, open the **Test** tab at the top of the page.
3.  Enable testing by selecting **Development** from the dropdown (it might say "Off" by default).
4.  Try your invocation in the text box (or use your microphone):

Once the skill is open, you can ask your agent questions directly: 

<PromptCard prompt="what’s the weather in New York" /> 

<Spacer size="md" /> 

## How Your Alexa-Connected Agent Works Behind the Scenes

-   The invocation (`open my agent`) "opens the channel" to your skill.
-   Everything you say after that is captured by the `SmythOSAgentIntent` and packaged into the `{searchQuery}` slot.
-   Alexa sends this query to your SmythOS HTTPS endpoint.
-   SmythOS processes the query with your agent's logic and returns a plain text response.
-   Alexa reads that response aloud to the user.

<Spacer size="md" /> 

## Known Limitations and Constraints

-   Only public agents without authentication are supported.
-   Alexa has limits on the character count and length of spoken responses.
-   Visuals, buttons, and complex UI (like cards) are not supported in this basic integration.
-   By default, the skill session ends after each interaction.

<Spacer size="md" /> 

## Optional: Publish Your Alexa Skill to the Public

Want to go public?

1.  Open the **[Distribution](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/devconsole/about-the-developer-console.html)** tab in the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) developer console.
2.  Fill in all the required information:
    -   Skill description and sample phrases
    -   Icons (108x108 and 512x512)
    -   Privacy Policy and Terms of Use URLs
3.  Submit your skill for certification.

## What’s Next?

Now that your voice interface is live:

-   Track usage and see incoming queries in your agent's **[Logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs)**.
-   Iterate on your agent's logic in SmythOS. You don't need to rebuild the Alexa model unless you change the invocation name or intents.
-   Explore other deployment options like **[MCP](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-mcp-server)** or **[ChatBot](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-chatbot)**.

Your agent just got its voice. What you do with it is up to you.

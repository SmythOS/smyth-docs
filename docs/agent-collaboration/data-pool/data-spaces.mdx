# Data Spaces

**Data Spaces** are named containers in the [Data Pool](/docs/agent-collaboration/data-pool) that hold files or raw text. These sources are indexed using vector embeddings so your agents can retrieve and use them through **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**. Each Data Space is backed by a vector database provider of your choice: SmythOS managed Pinecone, your own Pinecone instance, or Milvus.

<InfoCallout title="What makes Data Spaces useful">
Once indexed, your sources become part of your agent's contextual knowledge. This allows agents to answer questions, summarise content, and reference details from those documents in real time.
</InfoCallout>

## Setting Up Vector Database Providers

### SmythOS Managed Pinecone (Default)

No additional setup required. Start indexing immediately with our managed infrastructure.

### Your Own Pinecone or Milvus

To use a custom provider, you'll need to create a provider connection first:

1. When creating a Data Space, click **Vector Database Provider** dropdown
2. Click **Create New Connection**
3. Select your provider type: **Pinecone** or **Milvus**
4. Enter your provider credentials:

#### Pinecone Connection

- **Connection Name** – A label for this connection (e.g., "Production Pinecone")
- **API Key** – Your Pinecone API key
- **Index Name** – The name of your Pinecone index

#### Milvus Connection

- **Connection Name** – A label for this connection (e.g., "Self-Hosted Milvus")
- **Address** – The address/endpoint of your Milvus server
- **Token** – Your Milvus authentication token

<TipCallout title="Organize multiple connections">
Create multiple provider connections from the same service or account. For example, create separate connections for "Dev Pinecone" and "Prod Pinecone" to keep environments organized.
</TipCallout>

5. Click **Create Connection**
6. The connection is now available in your provider dropdown

<WarningCallout title="Vector dimension compatibility">
Ensure your vector database index is configured with dimensions that match your embedding model. Mismatched dimensions will prevent indexing.
</WarningCallout>

## Managing Data Sources

### Adding a Data Source

1. From the Data Pool, click **Add Data Source** in the Actions column for your Data Space
2. The **Upload Datasource** modal opens
3. Enter a **Datasource Label** for reference
4. Choose your upload method:
   - **Upload File** – Select `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` files (max 10MB)
   - **Raw Text** – Paste text content directly
5. (Optional) Expand **Advanced Configuration** to customize:
   - **Chunk Size** – How many characters per chunk (default: 1000)
   - **Chunk Overlap** – Overlap between chunks for context (default: 200)
   - **Custom Metadata** – Add JSON metadata to enrich the source (e.g., author, date, tags)
6. Click **Upload** to add the source

<Image src="/docs/img/data_pool/data_spaces/add-data-source-popup.png" alt="Add Data Source modal in SmythOS" caption="Files and text are transformed into searchable vector embeddings with customizable chunking." />

<Image src="/docs/img/data_pool/data_spaces/add-data-source-advanced.png" alt="Advanced Configuration section" caption="Fine-tune how your data is chunked and add custom metadata." />

<TipCallout title="Label clearly for easier reference">
Use titles like "2024 Pricing Guide" instead of generic names like "Document 1."
</TipCallout>

### Viewing Data Source Details

1. Navigate to a Data Space
2. View the **Datasources** table showing:
   - **Name** – The datasource label
   - **Size** – File/content size
   - **Created** – Timestamp of creation
   - **Actions** – View details or delete
3. Click the **View Details** icon to see:
   - Number of vectors created
   - Total size
   - Creation timestamp
   - Chunking configuration (chunk size and overlap)
   - Metadata fields (title, author, date, tags)
   - Preview of the source content

<Image src="/docs/img/data_pool/data_spaces/datasource-details-modal.png" alt="Data Source Details modal" caption="Review configuration and content of any indexed source." />

### Deleting a Data Source

1. Click the **Delete** icon in the Actions column for a datasource
2. Confirm the deletion
3. The source is immediately removed from your Data Space

<WarningCallout title="Deletion is permanent">
Removing a data source also removes its embeddings from your vector database. Agents will no longer have access to that content.
</WarningCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## How Indexing Works

Indexing starts automatically once a source is added. The embedding process:

1. **Chunking** – Your content is split into chunks based on your configured chunk size and overlap
2. **Embedding** – Each chunk is converted to vector embeddings using your selected embedding model
3. **Storage** – Embeddings are stored in your vector database provider (SmythOS Pinecone, your Pinecone, or Milvus)
4. **Availability** – Once indexed, agents can immediately retrieve and use the content

<InfoCallout title="Behind the scenes">
Indexing turns your files and text into vector embeddings through semantic analysis. These embeddings are stored in your vector database and made available to agents via semantic search.
</InfoCallout>

## Manage and Organize Spaces

From the Data Pool overview:

- **View all spaces** – See your Data Spaces in a table with provider and embedding model information
- **Add sources** – Click **Add Data Source** to upload files or paste text
- **View datasources** – Click on a Data Space row to enter the datasources view
- **Delete a space** – Click the **Delete** icon to remove an entire Data Space

<WarningCallout title="Deleting a space is permanent">
Removing a Data Space also deletes all its sources and embeddings from your vector database. Agents depending on this data will no longer have access to it.
</WarningCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Use Data Spaces in Agents

To connect a Data Space to an agent:

1. Open your [Project Space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces)
2. Select or create an agent
3. Attach one or more Data Spaces with the RAG components

Once connected, the agent uses semantic retrieval to reference indexed content during execution.

<SuccessCallout title="Instant RAG support">
After attaching a space, your agent can immediately start pulling context from it in responses and workflows.
</SuccessCallout>

## Understanding Chunking and Metadata

### Chunking Configuration

**Chunk Size** controls how your content is split:
- **Smaller chunks** (e.g., 500) – More granular retrieval, faster processing, higher token usage
- **Larger chunks** (e.g., 2000) – More context per chunk, better for complex documents, fewer API calls

**Chunk Overlap** ensures continuity between chunks:
- Prevents loss of context at chunk boundaries
- Default of 200 characters is suitable for most use cases
- Increase for highly technical or dense content

### Custom Metadata

Add structured metadata as JSON to enrich your datasources:

~~~json
{
  "title": "Q3 Financial Report",
  "author": "Finance Team",
  "date": "2024-09-30",
  "tags": ["finance", "quarterly", "2024"]
}
~~~

Metadata helps with:
- Organizing sources for better retrieval
- Filtering and categorization
- Adding context to agent responses

## FAQ

### What file types are supported?

You can upload `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` files, or paste raw text content directly.

### What is the maximum file size?

The maximum file size is **10MB** per datasource.

### Can a single space contain both files and raw text?

Yes. Data Spaces can include multiple file types and raw text sources mixed together.

### Is there a limit to how many sources I can add?

There is no enforced limit. For better performance and organisation, group similar content across separate spaces.

### Can I use different vector database providers for different Data Spaces?

Yes. Each Data Space can use a different provider. For example, use SmythOS Pinecone for testing and your own Pinecone for production.

### What happens if I modify chunking settings?

Chunking settings apply to new uploads. Existing sources keep their original chunking configuration. To re-chunk existing data, delete and re-upload the source.

### What if indexing fails?

Common causes include:
- File type not supported (use `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.docx`)
- File size exceeds 10MB
- Vector dimension mismatch with your database

Check these factors and retry. For additional support, review your [Custom Storage](/docs/agent-collaboration/data-pool/custom-storage) configuration.

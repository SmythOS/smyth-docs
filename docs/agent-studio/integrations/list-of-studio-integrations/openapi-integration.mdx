## Overview

The OpenAPI component in SmythOS allows you to integrate external tools and services that follow the OpenAPI specification. This powerful feature enables you to incorporate a wide range of pre-built tools directly into your SmythOS workflows by simply providing the tool's manifest URL.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🔌 Simple Integration**: Import any tool with an OpenAPI manifest URL (JSON or YAML format)
- **🤖 AI-Powered Functionality**: Each OpenAPI component functions as an agent with LLM capabilities
- **🧠 Model Flexibility**: Choose any compatible AI model for powering the component
- **🔄 Universal Compatibility**: Works with any tool that follows the OpenAPI specification

## How It Works

OpenAPI components bridge the gap between SmythOS workflows and external tools by leveraging standard OpenAPI specifications. Rather than building integrations from scratch, you can leverage existing tools and enhance them with AI capabilities.

### 🛠️ Configuration

To set up an OpenAPI component:

1. **📝 Manifest URL**: Enter the URL of the OpenAPI manifest (JSON or YAML format)
2. **🧪 Model Selection**: Choose which AI model will power the component
3. **🎯 Behavior Definition**: Configure how the component should interact with the tool and process responses

### 📥 Inputs and Outputs

OpenAPI components have a streamlined interface:

- **📤 Input**: A single `query` field that accepts user requests
- **📥 Output**: A single `output` field that returns processed results

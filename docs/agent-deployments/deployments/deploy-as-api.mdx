# Deploy as API

<InfoCallout title="Quick Steps (TL;DR)">
**1.** Open your agent → **Deploy → API → Get Endpoints**  
**2.** Test your endpoints in Swagger  
**3.** Share or import the OpenAPI URL  
</InfoCallout>

## Why Deploy as an API?

Deploying as an API turns your agent into a live REST service. You can test it in Swagger, share it with teammates, and integrate it into other apps with standard HTTP calls. Ideal for connecting workflows, building automations, and verifying inputs and outputs quickly.

## Prerequisites

- Your agent is [deployed](/docs/agent-deployments/overview)

## Step 1: Open the Deploy Panel

1. Open your agent in the canvas  
2. Click **Deploy** at the top right  
3. In **Embed**, select **API** and click **Get Endpoints**

  alt="Deploy panel showing API Get Endpoints option" 
/>

This opens the **API Endpoints** window with live Swagger and your OpenAPI URL.

## Step 2: Review the API Endpoints

You will see:

* **Dev API** and optional **Prod API** URL fields  
* Live **Swagger UI** to try requests  
* An **OpenAPI URL** for imports

<TipCallout title="Dev vs Prod">
Use Dev while building. Add Prod when your agent is stable and ready for wider use.

## Step 3: Test Directly in SmythOS

1. Click **Test** on the top toolbar  
2. Open the **API** tab in the right dock  
3. Choose an operation → **Try it out** → fill fields → **Execute**

<TipCallout title="Testing is key">
Testing here is the fastest way to validate requests and responses before any external integration.
</TipCallout>

## Share and Integrate

- Share the **OpenAPI URL** by copying the OpenAPI URL from API Endpoints  so teammates can explore your API in their tools  
- Import into Postman or SwaggerHub for collaboration and documentation  
- Call the API from apps and automations using standard HTTP\
- Use Dev while iterating and switch to Prod when ready to go live

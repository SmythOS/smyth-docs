# Introduction to Studio

Studio is where you build, test, and launch intelligent AI agents, without writing code. You choose the logic, connect the data, and control exactly how your agent thinks and acts.

<InfoCallout title="What is Studio?">
Studio is SmythOS’s visual builder. It lets you drag, drop, and connect prebuilt components into powerful AI workflows.
</InfoCallout>

## Start Here: What You Can Do

You can use Studio to:

- Design custom agent workflows with logic, memory, and multi-step reasoning  
- Connect to any API, internal tool, or third-party platform  
- Automate repetitive tasks across data, content, or support workflows  
- Deploy agents securely to run in production via chat, API, or webhooks  
- Test, debug, and monitor everything in one place

## Studio Platform Layout

Understanding the platform's layout will help you navigate and build more efficiently.

| Concept             | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Builder Canvas** | The visual drag-and-drop environment where you design and connect the components of your agent's workflow. |
| **Agents Page** | The dashboard where you can open, manage, and organize all your agents into different [Project Spaces](/docs/account-management/spaces-management). |
| **[Agent Settings](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/overview)** | A dedicated area to control an agent's behavior, security, and deployment configurations.      |
| **[The Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)** | A secure, centralized location to manage and use your API keys and other secrets across all your agents. |
| **[Analytics](/docs/agent-collaboration/analytics)** | A dashboard to monitor your token usage and control your costs.                                 |
| **[Data Pool](/docs/agent-collaboration/data-pool/data-spaces)** | A centralized RAG management system for your agent's knowledge base. |

## Core Features

These core capabilities help you build, test, and ship agents faster:

- **Visual Workflow Canvas**: Drag, drop, and connect components to define how your agent thinks and acts  
- **No-Code Debugging and Testing**: Inspect live agent runs, logs, and errors right inside the canvas  
- **Dynamic Input/Output Handling**: Work with text, images, files, and custom schema-based inputs  
- **Secure API Access**: Use [The Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault) to manage keys, tokens, and secrets  
- **Component Library**: Choose from 40+ production-ready tools, from LLMs to logic gates to API calls  

# Popular Use Cases

Agent Studio is a visual canvas designed to simplify the creation of complex AI agents. It provides a suite of tools that let you:

* **Visualize Workflows:** Instantly test, inspect, and refine your agent's logic as you build.
* **Integrate Seamlessly:** Connect your agent to any process on the internet, from internal tools using [webhooks](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-webhook) to thousands of third-party APIs.
* **Handle Multiple Inputs:** Define custom inputs and outputs to process text, images, files, and structured data.
* **Build with AI:** Leverage advanced components for classification, reasoning, and autonomous decision-making.
* **Customize Everything:** Modify every aspect of your agent, from its core logic to its final [deployment](/docs/agent-deployments/overview), with unparalleled control.

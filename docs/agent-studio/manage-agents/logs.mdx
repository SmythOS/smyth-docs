# Telemetry & Logs

Telemetry & Logs provides comprehensive insights into your agents' performance and behavior. Access real-time metrics, execution traces, detailed logs, and LLM performance data to troubleshoot issues, optimize efficiency, and monitor activity across all agents.

<Spacer size="md" />

## Key Benefits

Telemetry & Logs helps you:

- **Monitor Performance**: Track key metrics like conversation count, average response time, and error rates
- **Analyze Execution**: View detailed traces and step-by-step execution logs for each run
- **Debug Issues**: Identify component failures, logic breakdowns, and performance bottlenecks
- **Optimize LLM Usage**: Review LLM performance metrics, model selection, and Time To First Byte (TTFB) data
- **Track Component Health**: Analyze error rates and latency for individual components
- **Audit Activity**: Access up to 30 days of historical data for all agents

<InfoCallout>
Data is retained for **30 days** across all plan tiers, giving you complete visibility into your agent's recent activity and performance trends.

## Accessing Telemetry & Logs

### From the Sidebar

Navigate to **Telemetry & Logs** in the main sidebar to view aggregated data across **all agents**. From here, you can:
- Filter by specific agents using the agent dropdown
- Adjust the time range for analysis
- Explore different data views (Overview, Traces, Logs, LLM Performance, Components)

### From Agent Settings

Click on an agent card from the **Agent Dashboard** to open **Agent Settings**, then navigate to the **Telemetry & Logs** tab. This automatically filters all data to show only that agent's executions.

## Dashboard Tabs

### Overview

Get a high-level summary of agent performance with key metrics:

- **Conversations**: Total number of agent interactions during the selected period
- **Average Conversation Time**: Average duration of each agent execution
- **Skill Runs** (Component Executions): Total number of component/skill invocations
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed executions
- **Component Calls**: Total count of individual component calls
- **Activity Over Time Chart**: Visual trend of conversations, skill runs, and errors across the past 30 days

<TipCallout title="Tip">
Use the Overview tab to identify trends and anomalies. A sudden spike in error rate may indicate a recent deployment issue or external service outage.
</TipCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

### Traces

View detailed execution traces for individual agent runs:

- **Trace ID**: Unique identifier for each execution
- **Root**: The primary entity executed (e.g., Agent.Skill)
- **Agent**: The endpoint or agent that triggered the trace
- **Duration**: Total execution time
- **Spans**: Number of distinct operations within the trace
- **Errors**: Count of errors encountered during execution

Click on any trace row to inspect the complete execution flow and step-by-step component interactions.

<Spacer size="md" />

### Logs

Access structured logs for detailed event tracking:

- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **Severity**: Log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, etc.)
- **Message**: Description of the logged event
- **Agent**: Associated agent or endpoint
- **Trace ID**: Link to the related trace for context

Filter and search logs to quickly locate specific events or error messages.

<Spacer size="md" />

### LLM Performance

Monitor Large Language Model (LLM) usage and performance:

- **Total LLM Calls**: Aggregate count of LLM API calls
- **Average TTFB** (Time To First Byte): Average response latency from the LLM
- **TTFB by Model**: Breakdown of response times across different LLM models
- **Model Usage**: Which LLM models are being used and how frequently
- **Response Time Metrics**: Additional timing and performance data

Use this tab to compare LLM providers, identify slow models, and optimize model selection.

<TipCallout title="Optimize LLM Costs">
Monitor TTFB and model usage to identify opportunities for model switching or prompt optimization.
</TipCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

### Components

Analyze individual component performance and reliability:

- **Errors per Component**: Pie chart showing error distribution across components
- **Latency per Component (Top 10)**: Bar chart displaying response times for the most-used components
- **Component Calls**: Frequency of invocations for each component

Identify problematic or slow-running components and prioritize optimization efforts.

## Detailed Log Inspection

### View a Specific Run

Click on any trace or log entry to open the detailed execution view:

- **Component Name**: Name of the executed component
- **Component Type**: Classification (e.g., API call, GenAI, code execution)
- **Input Payload**: Data sent to the component
- **Output Payload**: Results returned by the component
- **Execution Status**: Success, failure, or warning indicators
- **Timing**: Duration of component execution

### Call Tree Visualization

The **Call Tree** provides a visual map of your agent's execution flow:

1. Open a trace from the **Traces** tab
2. Click **Show Call Tree** to visualize the execution path
3. A hierarchical tree displays each component, data transformation, and decision point
4. Follow the flow to identify silent failures or skipped branches

<TipCallout title="Tip">
Use the Call Tree to trace data flow through complex workflows and identify where logic diverges from expectations.
</TipCallout>

## Time Range Selection

By default, Telemetry & Logs displays data from the **past 30 days**. You can adjust the time range to focus on:

- Recent activity (last 24 hours, 7 days)
- Historical analysis (full 30-day window)
- Specific incidents or events

<Spacer size="md" />

## Filtering and Search

### Filter by Agent

When viewing Telemetry & Logs from the sidebar, use the **Agent dropdown** to filter:

- **All Agents**: View aggregated data across your entire workspace
- **Specific Agent**: Focus on a single agent's telemetry

### Search and Sort

- Sort logs by timestamp, severity, agent, or trace ID
- Search logs by message content or trace ID
- Filter traces by error status or duration ranges

<Spacer size="md" />

## Common Use Cases

### Debugging Agent Failures

1. Go to the **Overview** tab and note spikes in the **Error Rate**
2. Navigate to the **Traces** tab and filter for failed runs
3. Click on a failed trace to view the **Call Tree**
4. Inspect component inputs and outputs to identify the failure point
5. Check the **Logs** tab for error messages and stack traces

### Optimizing Performance

1. Review **Average Conversation Time** on the Overview tab
2. Identify slow components using the **Components** tab
3. Compare LLM performance across models in the **LLM Performance** tab
4. Adjust model selection, prompt engineering, or component logic based on findings

### Monitoring LLM Costs

1. Check **Total LLM Calls** and **TTFB by Model** in the **LLM Performance** tab
2. Identify underperforming or expensive models
3. Consider switching to faster or more cost-effective alternatives

### Troubleshooting Specific Issues

1. Search the **Logs** tab for error messages or component names
2. Click the associated **Trace ID** to view full execution context
3. Download the JSON log for detailed analysis or sharing with support
